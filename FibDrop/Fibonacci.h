/**
 Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, 
 and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum 
 of the preceding two numbers. 
 
 If the Fibonacci sequence is denoted F ( n ), where n is the first term in the sequence, 
 the following equation obtains for n = 0, where the first two terms are defined as 0 and 1 by convention:

 F (0) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...
 
 Notation: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
